# LOGS

Dated working log: what was done, what was decided, what's next. Complements `BUGS.md` (bugs) and `TODO.md` (open items).

## 2026-11-06 — Planning

**Done**
- Private repo created and renamed to `Larry8668/bellhop`; `docs/internal/` gitignored.
- Environment checked: Node 24.9, Ollama 0.40.3, `qwen3.5:9b` and `qwen3:8b` pulled. Both return clean tool calls on the Phase 0 smoke prompt; `qwen3:8b` stuffs budget/time constraints into `date_range`, `qwen3.5:9b` does not.
- Package versions checked: `ai` 7.0.x, `ai-sdk-ollama` 4.x, `better-auth` 1.7.x, `better-sqlite3` 13.x, `vitest` 5.x, `zod` 4.x.
- Plan rewritten to v2 (`docs/bellhopper-plan.md`); `TODO.md` and `LOGS.md` created.

**Decided**
- Drop Mastra. Its workflow snapshots would be a second source of truth next to our `proposals`/`approvals`/`intents` tables. AI SDK v7 `ToolLoopAgent` + `prepareStep` + `MockLanguageModelV4` cover the loop, the context hook, and offline evals.
- "Harness" = `prepareStep` context layer + limits + trace around `ToolLoopAgent`. Compaction is code-generated from `task_state`, no LLM summarizer.
- `ai-sdk-ollama` `reliableToolCalling` off so every model call is visible to limits and trace.
- Provider tools run as a separate mock HTTP service (`provider/`) with seeded RNG, injectable clock, own SQLite and admin endpoints to force scenarios. Backend talks to it only over HTTP; tests boot it on an ephemeral port.
- `propose_*` validates against `task_state` constraints (budget, window) because the fixed `search_providers` contract has no fields for them.
- Approval hash uses the hold's quoted price. Any price change after approval (up or down) voids approval. A re-hold with identical price/slot proceeds without re-asking.
- Approval sources: Confirm button (primary), typed yes checked by code when exactly one unexpired proposal is pending (config flag, default on), MCP elicitation.
- MCP: `/mcp` route on the server, API Key plugin for auth; elicitation for approval with fallback to confirm-in-UI link. Model never returns the approval. OAuth via `@better-auth/mcp` is a stretch.
- Better Auth stays (email + password) for user segregation; needed for MCP anyway.
- Monorepo with npm workspaces; docker-compose runs provider + server + web; Ollama stays on host (no Metal in Docker on Mac).
- `LOGS.md` replaces the draft plan's `NOTES.md`. Root-level deliverable files; `docs/` for plan and transcripts.
- Plan v2 signed off.
- Separate structured logger (pino) alongside the trace writer; trace is the deliverable, logs are for debugging, correlated by `run_id`/`turn_id`.

**Next**
- Plan sign-off, then Phase 0.
